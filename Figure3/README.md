The code under the markdown file PCoA_Figure3.rmd contains the R Markdown file used to create all of the figures. This code also stores and saves the three figures as Figure3A, 3B, and 3C and are jpeg files. 

In order to add some of the editing over the graphs I used "paint 3D" which is an appilcation for photo editing on windows computers. Once the files were edited they were saved with the "Final" name added onto the three figures.
The "Figure3FinalALL.jpeg" image is all three images spliced into one image similar to how the original paper created their figures.
